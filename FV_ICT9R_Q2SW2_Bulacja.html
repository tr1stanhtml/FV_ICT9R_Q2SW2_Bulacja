				<td>Scottish Fold</td>
				<td>There is nothing a Scottish Fold–named for their folded ears–likes better than to be with their people, participating in whatever they are doing. As the name implies, Scottish Folds come from Scotland, and they can all trace their ancestry back to a barn cat named Susie who had folded ears and worked as a mouser. These cats are sensitive, expressive, and active. They love to play and are not the best cats to leave home alone. They prefer a companion–even another cat–to keep them company. If you can provide this loving feline with the attention they crave and keep up with their needs, they just might be the new furry family member you’re looking for.<br><br><a href="https://cattime.com/cat-breeds/scottish-fold-cats#/slide/1">Read more...</a></td>
